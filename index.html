        <p> Exotropia is a type of strabismus, where one eye turns, or deviates, outward . The deviation may be constant or intermittent, and the deviating eye may always be one eye or may alternate between the two eyes. The deviation or eye turn may occur while looking at distant objects, near objects, or both. Exotropia is sometimes called wall-eyed . Exotropia is a form of strabismus where an eye deviates outward. It is the opposite of esotropia and occurs intermittently or constantly. someone with moderate or severe exophoria are more likely to develop intermittent exotropia.</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <br>
        <p>The distinguishing sign of exotropia is one or either eye wandering outward. Symptoms may be mild or severe. If suppression of the deviating eye occurs, the patient can have diminished binocular vision and poor or no stereopsis. Onemay also experience double vision or eye fatigue.

        <h1>Causes</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Causes of exotropia are mostly unknown. Children with a family history of the disorder are more likely to get them. They are also common in children who have other systemic disorders. The following may be causes of exotropia:
            • Binocular vision disorder
            • No known cause (idiopathic); possibly familial
            • Down syndrome
            • Cerebral palsy
            • Hydrocephalus (Increased intra-cranial pressure)
            • Brain tumors
            • Trauma
            • Sensory deprivation
            .

        <h3>Pencil Pushups</h3>
        <p>Convergence insufficiency may be diagnosed after a comprehensive eye examination by a qualified eye doctor. Once a diagnosis of convergence insufficiency has been made, a simple visual therapy technique that may be helpful is “pencil pushups.”
            <br>
            <br>
            1.Hold a pencil, with the eraser about level with the tip of your nose.
            <br>
            <img src="Pen(1%20out%20of%204).jpg">
            <br>
            2. Looking at the eraser, gradually bring it closer to your eyes.
            <br>
            <img src="Pen(2%20out%20of%204).jpg">
            <br>
            3. Bring it closer to your nose until you see double (two erasers). Slowly push it back until you see one eraser again, and then hold it there.
            <br>
            <span><img src="Pen(I%20out%20of%20IV).jpg"><img src="Pen(I%20out%20of%20IV).jpg"><img src="Arrow.gif"><img src="Pen(I%20out%20of%20IV).jpg"></span>

            <br>
            4. Bring it about an inch closer again. If it doubles, keep the pencil there and try to make it single by converging your eyes a bit harder. Hold it there a few more seconds.
            <br>
            <span><img src="Pen(I%20out%20of%20IV).jpg"><img src="Arrow.gif"><img src="Pen(I%20out%20of%20IV).jpg"><img src="Pen(I%20out%20of%20IV).jpg"><img src="Arrow.gif"><img src="Pen(I%20out%20of%20IV).jpg"></span>
            <br>
            It is not critical to keep the pencil and eraser clear as you bring it closer to you. What is important is to keep it single.
            Do this exercise 3 to 5 times a day or whenever eyestrain or a work-related headache develops. Over time, try to get the pencil eraser as close to your nose as possible, still keeping it single. Some people can keep the pencil single all the way up to their noses, but bringing it that close is not necessary. If you can bring it to within 3 to 5 inches away, that is doing well.
            This exercise strengthens your medial rectus muscles, which pull your eyes inward. Eventually, it should become easy to look from far to near, back and forth, without feeling any strain on the eyes. Also, there also should be less eyestrain when doing extended periods of near work, such as reading, writing, drawing, or viewing a computer screen.
